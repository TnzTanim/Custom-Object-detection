In this video tutorial, I walk through the steps involved in creating and utilizing the custom object detector. You'll gain insights into the technical details and practical implementation.

## Simplifying Model Creation

Creating a custom object detection model from scratch can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring proficiency in libraries such as PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow. However, there's a shortcut available. You can leverage the user-friendly [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) website to generate machine learning models using your own dataset.

## Getting Started

To use the custom object detection model I've provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Edit the labels and model name according to your requirements.
3. You're all set! You can now utilize the pre-trained custom object detector for your own projects.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different datasets, and adapt the model to your specific use cases. Best of luck with your projects!
