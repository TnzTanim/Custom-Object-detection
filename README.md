# Explanation 

As you can simply see from the video, I made a object detector using custom dataset and implemented it Real-Time.
The model is already trained and here is just the Implementation code.I used Tensorflow and keras to make the model.h5. You can creat your own model using keras. But it's a long and complicatesd process, you need to have some familiraty with pytorch,keras and tensorflow. But there is a shortcut. You can visit https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ . This website can generate Machine Learning models using the data you give. It's really simple to use. After making your model just copy my repo, edit the labels and model name. Hope It'll work.
