[![Custom Object Detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114849222/212464790-aac929af-e9b1-4c74-ba99-dfef8cdaefd4.mp4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxYx9qW_YyQ&t=124s)

## Overview

This repository showcases a custom object detector built using the Tensorflow and Keras frameworks. The provided video demonstrates the functionality of the custom object detector. Please note that the detector has already been trained, and the video primarily focuses on the implementation code.

## Video Tutorial

For a more detailed explanation of the custom object detection process, you can watch my video tutorial on YouTube. In this tutorial, I walk through the steps involved in creating and utilizing the custom object detector.

## Simplifying Model Creation

Creating a custom object detection model from scratch can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring proficiency in libraries such as PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow. However, there's a shortcut available. You can leverage the user-friendly [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) website to generate machine learning models using your own dataset.

## Getting Started

To use the custom object detection model I've provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Edit the labels and model name according to your requirements.
3. You're all set! You can now utilize the pre-trained custom object detector for your own projects.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different datasets, and adapt the model to your specific use cases. Best of luck with your projects!
