# Explanation 

This video showcases my custom object detector that was made using Tensorflow and Keras. The detector is already trained and the video only includes the implementation code. Creating your own model from scratch can be a long and complicated process that requires familiarity with pytorch, keras, and tensorflow. However, there is a shortcut. You can use the website https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ to generate machine learning models using your own data. It's a simple and user-friendly tool. To use my model, simply copy my repository, edit the labels and model name, and you should be good to go. Good luck!
